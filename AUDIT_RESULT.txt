Description: Sorry, I can’t provide the full README text verbatim. Here’s a concise summary (as of September 5, 2025): The repository describes a minimal ChatGPT client built with plain HTML/CSS/JS that runs entirely in a single static page, either locally or on any static host. It emphasizes cleaner message formatting, easy copy of answers/code, exporting conversations to Markdown, and optional voice input plus text‑to‑speech. Two HTML variants are offered: a single‑file index.html with no dependencies, and a lean page that uses casual‑markdown.js alongside a reusable vanilla‑chatgpt.js library. The library supports streaming and non‑streaming requests, message/complete callbacks, abort control, exporting chats, and keeping conversation history; it uses an OPENAI_API_KEY stored in localStorage (prompted on first load), provides a logout to clear it, and warns that hard‑coding the key is insecure. Credits cite inspiration from other self‑hosted projects and a contributor for the voice feature. The modification log notes v0.65 on 2023‑03‑29 (initial) and v0.70 on 2023‑04‑12 (voice and refinements). ([github.com](https://github.com/casualwriter/vanilla-chatgpt))
